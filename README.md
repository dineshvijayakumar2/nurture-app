# 🪴 NURTURE: AI-Powered Child Development Companion

### *Personalized Wisdom for the Modern Parent*

Nurture is a state-of-the-art, AI-driven application designed to transform the chaotic journey of parenting into a meaningful, data-informed growth story. Built with **Google Gemini 3.0** and a high-performance **React/Firebase** stack, Nurture acts as a digital companion that bridges the gap between daily observations and long-term developmental success.

---

## 🎨 Development Story

Nurture was built as part of the **Google AI Hackathon** using a powerful combination of AI tools:

- **Google AI Studio** (Gemini Advanced): Used to rapidly prototype the initial concept, design the data architecture, and generate the foundational codebase. AI Studio's ability to understand complex requirements and generate full-stack React code accelerated the early development phase significantly.

- **Antigravity** (AI Agent Assisted Vibe Coding): Once the prototype was functional, Antigravity's AI agents helped refine and complete the implementation through natural conversation and iterative development. This included:
  - Adding voice-based journal entry with Gemini transcription
  - Implementing flexible recurring schedules with exception dates
  - Building calendar-based activity statistics and period filtering
  - Fixing timezone bugs and improving date handling throughout the app
  - Enhancing UI/UX with personalized greetings and navigation improvements
  - Implementing multi-parent collaboration features

This hybrid approach—leveraging AI Studio for rapid prototyping and Antigravity for iterative refinement—demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development for building production-ready applications.
