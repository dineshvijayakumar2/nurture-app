## 🌟 The Vision
In an era of information overload, parents are drowning in generic advice but lack specific insights into their own child's unique development. Nurture's mission is to provide a **"Third Eye"** for parents—using AI to spot patterns, suggest values-based actions, and provide personalized developmental insights tailored to your family.
